# Catfish
Very simple two player chess game made in python using bitboards for the logic and Pygame for the interface. Pygame is the only dependency to install.

### How to play
First, download this repo and create a virtual environment. Then, install Pygame and run `python src/main.py` to play!

Use the mouse and click on the squares to make a move. Use the `z` key to undo a move.
